# [405. Convert a Number to Hexadecimal](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/convert-a-number-to-hexadecimal/)

Given an integer, write an algorithm to convert it to hexadecimal. For negative integer, two’s complement method is used.

Note:

All letters in hexadecimal (a-f) must be in lowercase.
The hexadecimal string must not contain extra leading 0s. If the number is zero, it is represented by a single zero character '0'; otherwise, the first character in the hexadecimal string will not be the zero character.
The given number is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
You must not use any method provided by the library which converts/formats the number to hex directly.
**Example 1:**

```
Input:
26

Output:
"1a"
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input:
-1

Output:
"ffffffff"
```

## Solution

移位or除法取余都可。



## Code

```python
class Solution(object):
    def toHex(self, num):
        """
        :type num: int
        :rtype: str
        """
        if num == 0:
            return "0"
        res = ""
        table = "0123456789abcdef"
        while num and len(res)<8:
            cur = num & 15
            num >>= 4
            res += table[cur]
        return res[::-1]
```
