# 636. Exclusive Time of Functions

On a **single threaded** CPU, we execute some functions.  Each function has a unique id between `0` and `N-1`.

We store logs in timestamp order that describe when a function is entered or exited.

Each log is a string with this format: `"{function_id}:{"start" | "end"}:{timestamp}"`.  For example, `"0:start:3"` means the function with id `0` **started at the beginning** of timestamp `3`.  `"1:end:2"` means the function with id `1` **ended at the end** of timestamp `2`.

A function's *exclusive time* is the number of units of time spent in this function.  Note that this does **not** include any recursive calls to child functions.

The CPU is **single threaded** which means that only one function is being executed at a given time unit.

Return the exclusive time of each function, sorted by their function id.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
n = 2
logs = ["0:start:0","1:start:2","1:end:5","0:end:6"]
Output: [3, 4]
Explanation:
Function 0 starts at the beginning of time 0, then it executes 2 units of time and reaches the end of time 1.
Now function 1 starts at the beginning of time 2, executes 4 units of time and ends at time 5.
Function 0 is running again at the beginning of time 6, and also ends at the end of time 6, thus executing for 1 unit of time. 
So function 0 spends 2 + 1 = 3 units of total time executing, and function 1 spends 4 units of total time executing.
```

 

**Note:**

1. `1 <= n <= 100`
2. Two functions won't start or end at the same time.
3. Functions will always log when they exit.



## Code

```python
class Solution(object):
    def exclusiveTime(self, n, logs):
        """
        :type n: int
        :type logs: List[str]
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        res = [0 for _ in range(n)]
        length = len(logs)
        record = [log.split(":") for log in logs]
        stack = []
        # print(record)
            
        record.sort(key = lambda x:int(x[2]))
        for item in record:
            idd, event, time = item
            idd = int(idd)
            time = int(time)
            if event == "start":
                if stack:
                    res[stack[-1][0]] += time - stack[-1][1]
                stack.append([idd,time])
            elif event == "end":
                preid, pretime = stack.pop()
                res[preid] += time - pretime + 1
                if stack:
                    stack[-1][1] = time + 1
        return res
```
