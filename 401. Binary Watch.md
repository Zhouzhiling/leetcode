# [401. Binary Watch](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/binary-watch/)

A binary watch has 4 LEDs on the top which represent the hours (0-11), and the 6 LEDs on the bottom represent the minutes (0-59).

Each LED represents a zero or one, with the least significant bit on the right.


For example, the above binary watch reads "3:25".

Given a non-negative integer n which represents the number of LEDs that are currently on, return all possible times the watch could represent.

**Example:**

```python
Input: n = 1
Return: ["1:00", "2:00", "4:00", "8:00", "0:01", "0:02", "0:04", "0:08", "0:16", "0:32"]
Note:
The order of output does not matter.
The hour must not contain a leading zero, for example "01:00" is not valid, it should be "1:00".
The minute must be consist of two digits and may contain a leading zero, for example "10:2" is not valid, it should be "10:02".
```



## Code

```python
class Solution(object):
    def readBinaryWatch(self, num):
        """
        :type num: int
        :rtype: List[str]
        """
        return ["%d:%02d"%(i,j) for j in range(60) for i in range(12) if bin(i).count('1')+bin(j).count('1')==num]

```
