# 251.  Flatten 2D Vector 压平二维向量

Implement an iterator to flatten a 2d vector.

For example,
Given 2d vector =

```
[
  [1,2],
  [3],
  [4,5,6]
]
```

 

By calling *next* repeatedly until *hasNext* returns false, the order of elements returned by *next* should be: `[1,2,3,4,5,6]`.

Hint:

1. How many variables do you need to keep track?
2. Two variables is all you need. Try with `x` and `y`.
3. Beware of empty rows. It could be the first few rows.
4. To write correct code, think about the [invariant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invariant_(computer_science)) to maintain. What is it?
5. The invariant is `x` and `y` must always point to a valid point in the 2d vector. Should you maintain your invariant *ahead of time* or *right when you need it*?
6. Not sure? Think about how you would implement `hasNext()`. Which is more complex?
7. Common logic in two different places should be refactored into a common method.

As an added challenge, try to code it using only [iterators in C++](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/iterator/iterator/) or [iterators in Java](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Iterator.html).





## Code

```python
from heapq import *
vector = [[1,2], [3], [4,5,6]]
length = len(vector)
points = [0 for _ in range(length)]
heap = []
for i in range(length):
    if points[i]<len(vector[i]):
        heap.append([vector[i][points[i]],i])
        points[i] += 1
heapify(heap)
output = []
while heap:
    val, idx = heappop(heap)
    output.append(val)
    if points[idx]<len(vector[idx]):
        heappush(heap, [vector[idx][points[idx]],idx])
        points[idx] += 1
print(output)
```
