# 5214. Longest Arithmetic Subsequence of Given Difference

Given an integer array `arr` and an integer `difference`, return the length of the longest subsequence in `arr` which is an arithmetic sequence such that the difference between adjacent elements in the subsequence equals `difference`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: arr = [1,2,3,4], difference = 1
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest arithmetic subsequence is [1,2,3,4].
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: arr = [1,3,5,7], difference = 1
Output: 1
Explanation: The longest arithmetic subsequence is any single element.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: arr = [1,5,7,8,5,3,4,2,1], difference = -2
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest arithmetic subsequence is [7,5,3,1].
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= arr.length <= 10^5`
- `-10^4 <= arr[i], difference <= 10^4`



## Code

```python
class Solution(object):
    def longestSubsequence(self, arr, difference):
        """
        :type arr: List[int]
        :type difference: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        visited = {}
        length = len(arr)
        table = [0 for _ in range(length)]
        result = 0
        for i, num in enumerate(arr):
            if num-difference in visited:
                table[i] = table[visited[num-difference]] + 1
            else:
                table[i] = 1
            result = max(result, table[i])
            visited[num] = i
        
        return result
        
```
