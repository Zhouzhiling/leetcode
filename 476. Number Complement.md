# 476. Number Complement

Given a positive integer, output its complement number. The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.

**Note:**

1. The given integer is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
2. You could assume no leading zero bit in the integer’s binary representation.



**Example 1:**

```
Input: 5
Output: 2
Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.
```



**Example 2:**

```
Input: 1
Output: 0
Explanation: The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 0. So you need to output 0.
```



## Code

```python
class Solution(object):
    def findComplement(self, num):
        """
        :type num: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        num2 = num
        ones = 0
        
        while num2 > 0:
            num2 >>= 1
            ones = (ones << 1) + 1
            # ones += 1
        return (num ^ ones)
```
