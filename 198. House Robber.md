# 198. House Robber

You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security system connected and **it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night**.

Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house, determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight **without alerting the police**.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [1,2,3,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
             Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [2,7,9,3,1]
Output: 12
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 2), rob house 3 (money = 9) and rob house 5 (money = 1).
             Total amount you can rob = 2 + 9 + 1 = 12.
```

## Code

```java
class Solution {
    public int rob(int[] nums) {
        int len = nums.length;
        int[] res = new int[len];
        if(len==0)
            return 0;
        if(len==1)
            return nums[0];
        
        res[0] = nums[0];
        res[1] = Math.max(nums[1],res[0]);
        for(int i=2;i<len;i++)
            res[i] = Math.max(nums[i]+res[i-2],res[i-1]);
        return res[len-1];
    }
}
