# 448. Find All Numbers Disappeared in an Array

Given an array of integers where 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ *n* (*n* = size of array), some elements appear twice and others appear once.

Find all the elements of [1, *n*] inclusive that do not appear in this array.

Could you do it without extra space and in O(*n*) runtime? You may assume the returned list does not count as extra space.

**Example:**

```
Input:
[4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]

Output:
[5,6]
```



## Code

```python
class Solution(object):
    def findDisappearedNumbers(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        for num in nums:
            if nums[abs(num)-1] > 0:
                nums[abs(num)-1] *= -1
        
        res = []
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[i]>0:
                res.append(i+1)
        return res
```
