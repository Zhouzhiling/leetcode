# 1209. Remove All Adjacent Duplicates in String II

Given a string `s`, a *k* *duplicate removal* consists of choosing `k` adjacent and equal letters from `s` and removing them causing the left and the right side of the deleted substring to concatenate together.

We repeatedly make `k` duplicate removals on `s` until we no longer can.

Return the final string after all such duplicate removals have been made.

It is guaranteed that the answer is unique.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "abcd", k = 2
Output: "abcd"
Explanation: There's nothing to delete.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "deeedbbcccbdaa", k = 3
Output: "aa"
Explanation: 
First delete "eee" and "ccc", get "ddbbbdaa"
Then delete "bbb", get "dddaa"
Finally delete "ddd", get "aa"
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "pbbcggttciiippooaais", k = 2
Output: "ps"
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`
- `2 <= k <= 10^4`
- `s` only contains lower case English letters.

## Solution

注意下，k-1不能删，k可以删，k+1只能删k，2k可以删

方法绝了。



## Code

```python
class Solution(object):
    def removeDuplicates(self, s, k):
        """
        :type s: str
        :type k: int
        :rtype: str
        """
        stack = []
        for ch in s:
            if not stack or stack[-1][0] != ch:
                stack.append([ch,1])
            else:
                stack[-1][1] += 1
                if stack[-1][1] == k:
                    stack.pop()
        res = ""
        for c, i in stack:
            res += c*i
        return res
```
