#  671. Second Minimum Node In a Binary Tree 

Given a non-empty special binary tree consisting of nodes with the non-negative value, where each node in this tree has exactly `two` or `zero` sub-node. If the node has two sub-nodes, then this node's value is the smaller value among its two sub-nodes. More formally, the property `root.val = min(root.left.val, root.right.val)` always holds.

Given such a binary tree, you need to output the **second minimum** value in the set made of all the nodes' value in the whole tree.

If no such second minimum value exists, output -1 instead.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: 
    2
   / \
  2   5
     / \
    5   7

Output: 5
Explanation: The smallest value is 2, the second smallest value is 5.
```

 

**Example 2:**

```
Input: 
    2
   / \
  2   2

Output: -1
Explanation: The smallest value is 2, but there isn't any second smallest value.
```



## Code

```python
class Solution(object):
    def findSecondMinimumValue(self, root):
        """
        :type root: TreeNode
        :rtype: int
        """
        if root is None:
            return -1
        rootval = root.val
        curmin = float('inf')
        queue = []
        queue.append(root)
        while queue:
            node = queue.pop(0)
            if rootval < node.val < curmin:
                curmin = node.val
            if node.left:
                queue.append(node.left)
                queue.append(node.right)
        return curmin if curmin!=float('inf') else -1
```
