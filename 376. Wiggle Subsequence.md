## 376. Wiggle Subsequence

A sequence of numbers is called a **wiggle sequence** if the differences between successive numbers strictly alternate between positive and negative. The first difference (if one exists) may be either positive or negative. A sequence with fewer than two elements is trivially a wiggle sequence.

For example, `[1,7,4,9,2,5]` is a wiggle sequence because the differences `(6,-3,5,-7,3)` are alternately positive and negative. In contrast, `[1,4,7,2,5]` and `[1,7,4,5,5]` are not wiggle sequences, the first because its first two differences are positive and the second because its last difference is zero.

Given a sequence of integers, return the length of the longest subsequence that is a wiggle sequence. A subsequence is obtained by deleting some number of elements (eventually, also zero) from the original sequence, leaving the remaining elements in their original order.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [1,7,4,9,2,5]
Output: 6
Explanation: The entire sequence is a wiggle sequence.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [1,17,5,10,13,15,10,5,16,8]
Output: 7
Explanation: There are several subsequences that achieve this length. One is [1,17,10,13,10,16,8].
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
Output: 2
```



## Code1

```java
class Solution {
    public int wiggleMaxLength(int[] nums) {
        int len = nums.length;
        if(len==0)
            return 0;
        int[] inc = new int[len];
        int[] dec = new int[len];
        inc[0] = 1;
        dec[0] = 1;
        for(int i=1;i<len;i++)
        {
            int num = nums[i];
            inc[i] = 1;
            dec[i] = 1;
            for(int j=0;j<i;j++)
            {
                if(num>nums[j])
                    inc[i] = Math.max(inc[i],dec[j]+1);
                if(num<nums[j])
                    dec[i] = Math.max(dec[i],inc[j]+1);
            }
            // System.out.println(inc[i]);
            // System.out.println(dec[i]);
            // System.out.println("---");
        }
        return Math.max(inc[len-1],dec[len-1]);
    }
}
```



## Code2

```java
class Solution {
    public int wiggleMaxLength(int[] nums) {
        int len = nums.length;
        int[] inc = new int[len];
        int[] dec = new int[len];
        if(len==0)
            return 0;
        inc[0] = 1;
        dec[0] = 1;
        
        for(int i=1;i<len;i++)
        {
            int num1 = nums[i];
            int num2 = nums[i-1];
            if(num1 > num2)
            {
                inc[i] = dec[i-1] + 1;
                dec[i] = dec[i-1];
            }
            else if(num1 < num2)
            {
                dec[i] = inc[i-1] + 1;
                inc[i] = inc[i-1];
            }
            else
            {
                dec[i] = dec[i-1];
                inc[i] = inc[i-1];
            } 
            
        }
        return Math.max(inc[len-1],dec[len-1]);
    }
