#  \783. Minimum Distance Between BST Nodes 

Given a Binary Search Tree (BST) with the root node `root`, return the minimum difference between the values of any two different nodes in the tree.

**Example :**

```
Input: root = [4,2,6,1,3,null,null]
Output: 1
Explanation:
Note that root is a TreeNode object, not an array.

The given tree [4,2,6,1,3,null,null] is represented by the following diagram:

          4
        /   \
      2      6
     / \    
    1   3  

while the minimum difference in this tree is 1, it occurs between node 1 and node 2, also between node 3 and node 2.
```

**Note:**

1. The size of the BST will be between 2 and `100`.
2. The BST is always valid, each node's value is an integer, and each node's value is different.



## Code

```python
class Solution(object):
    def minDiffInBST(self, root):
        """
        :type root: TreeNode
        :rtype: int
        """
        stack = []
        node = root
        pre = None
        mindiff = float('inf')
        while node or stack:
            while node:
                stack.append(node)
                node = node.left
            node = stack.pop()
            if pre is not None:
                mindiff = min(mindiff, node.val-pre)
            pre = node.val
            node = node.right
        return mindiff
```
