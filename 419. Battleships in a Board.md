# 419. Battleships in a Board

Given an 2D board, count how many battleships are in it. The battleships are represented with `'X'``'.'`

- You receive a valid board, made of only battleships or empty slots.
- Battleships can only be placed horizontally or vertically. In other words, they can only be made of the shape `1xN` (1 row, N columns) or `Nx1` (N rows, 1 column), where N can be of any size.
- At least one horizontal or vertical cell separates between two battleships - there are no adjacent battleships.

**Example:**

```
X..X
...X
...X
```

In the above board there are 2 battleships.

**Invalid Example:**

```
...X
XXXX
...X
```

This is an invalid board that you will not receive - as battleships will always have a cell separating between them.



**Follow up:**
Could you do it in **one-pass**, using only **O(1) extra memory** and **without modifying** the value of the board?



## Code

```python
class Solution(object):
    def countBattleships(self, board):
        """
        :type board: List[List[str]]
        :rtype: int
        """
        height = len(board)
        width = len(board[0])
        count = 0
        for i in range(height):
            for j in range(width):
                if board[i][j] == '.':
                    continue
                elif i>0 and board[i-1][j] == 'X':
                    continue
                elif j>0 and board[i][j-1] == 'X':
                    continue
                count += 1
        return count
```
