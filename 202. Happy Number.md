# 202. Happy Number

Write an algorithm to determine if a number is "happy".

A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.

**Example:** 

```
Input: 19
Output: true
Explanation: 
12 + 92 = 82
82 + 22 = 68
62 + 82 = 100
12 + 02 + 02 = 1
```





## Solution

用个hashset来记录有没有重复就行了。



## Code

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isHappy(int n) {
        HashSet<Integer> set = new HashSet<Integer>();
        int m = 0;
        int rem=0;
        while(n!=1)
        {
            if(set.contains(n))
                return false;
            set.add(n);
            m = 0;
            while(n>0)
            {
                rem = n % 10;
                n /= 10;
                m += rem*rem;
            }
            n = m;
        }
        return n==1;
    }
}
```
