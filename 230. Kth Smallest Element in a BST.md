# 230. Kth Smallest Element in a BST

Given a binary search tree, write a function `kthSmallest` to find the **k**th smallest element in it.

**Note:**
You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ BST's total elements.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: root = [3,1,4,null,2], k = 1
   3
  / \
 1   4
  \
   2
Output: 1
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,null,1], k = 3
       5
      / \
     3   6
    / \
   2   4
  /
 1
Output: 3
```

**Follow up:**
What if the BST is modified (insert/delete operations) often and you need to find the kth smallest frequently? How would you optimize the kthSmallest routine?



## Code

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution(object):
    def kthSmallest(self, root, k):
        """
        :type root: TreeNode
        :type k: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        stack = []
        node = root
        while stack or node:
            while node:
                stack.append(node)
                node = node.left
            node = stack.pop()
            k -= 1
            if k == 0:
                break
            node = node.right
        return node.val
```
