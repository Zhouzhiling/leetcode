# 496. Next Greater Element I

You are given two arrays **(without duplicates)** `nums1` and `nums2` where `nums1`’s elements are subset of `nums2`. Find all the next greater numbers for `nums1`'s elements in the corresponding places of `nums2`.

The Next Greater Number of a number **x** in `nums1` is the first greater number to its right in `nums2`. If it does not exist, output -1 for this number.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums1 = [4,1,2], nums2 = [1,3,4,2].
Output: [-1,3,-1]
Explanation:
    For number 4 in the first array, you cannot find the next greater number for it in the second array, so output -1.
    For number 1 in the first array, the next greater number for it in the second array is 3.
    For number 2 in the first array, there is no next greater number for it in the second array, so output -1.
```



**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums1 = [2,4], nums2 = [1,2,3,4].
Output: [3,-1]
Explanation:
    For number 2 in the first array, the next greater number for it in the second array is 3.
    For number 4 in the first array, there is no next greater number for it in the second array, so output -1.
```



**Note:**

1. All elements in `nums1` and `nums2` are unique.
2. The length of both `nums1` and `nums2` would not exceed 1000.



## Code

```python
class Solution(object):
    def nextGreaterElement(self, nums1, nums2):
        """
        :type nums1: List[int]
        :type nums2: List[int]
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        map = {}
        stack = []
        for num in nums2:
            if not stack or num<=stack[-1]:
                stack.append(num)
            else:
                while stack and stack[-1]<num:
                    map[stack.pop()] = num
                stack.append(num)
        res = []
        for num in nums1:
            res.append(map.get(num,-1))
        return res
```
