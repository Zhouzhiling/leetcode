#  557. Reverse Words in a String III 

Given a string, you need to reverse the order of characters in each word within a sentence while still preserving whitespace and initial word order.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: "Let's take LeetCode contest"
Output: "s'teL ekat edoCteeL tsetnoc"
```



**Note:** In the string, each word is separated by single space and there will not be any extra space in the string.



## Code

```python
class Solution(object):
    def reverseWords(self, s):
        """
        :type s: str
        :rtype: str
        """
        words = s.split()
        return " ".join(word[::-1] for word in words)
```
