# 433. Minimum Genetic Mutation

A gene string can be represented by an 8-character long string, with choices from `"A"`, `"C"`, `"G"`, `"T"`.

Suppose we need to investigate about a mutation (mutation from "start" to "end"), where ONE mutation is defined as ONE single character changed in the gene string.

For example, `"AACCGGTT"` -> `"AACCGGTA"` is 1 mutation.

Also, there is a given gene "bank", which records all the valid gene mutations. A gene must be in the bank to make it a valid gene string.

Now, given 3 things - start, end, bank, your task is to determine what is the minimum number of mutations needed to mutate from "start" to "end". If there is no such a mutation, return -1.

**Note:**

1. Starting point is assumed to be valid, so it might not be included in the bank.
2. If multiple mutations are needed, all mutations during in the sequence must be valid.
3. You may assume start and end string is not the same.

 

**Example 1:**

```
start: "AACCGGTT"
end:   "AACCGGTA"
bank: ["AACCGGTA"]

return: 1
```

 

**Example 2:**

```
start: "AACCGGTT"
end:   "AAACGGTA"
bank: ["AACCGGTA", "AACCGCTA", "AAACGGTA"]

return: 2
```

 

**Example 3:**

```
start: "AAAAACCC"
end:   "AACCCCCC"
bank: ["AAAACCCC", "AAACCCCC", "AACCCCCC"]

return: 3
```



## Solution

看了discussion但是里面的方法不能解决有循环的情况。所以自己做了一些改进。



## Code

```python
class Solution(object):
    def minMutation(self, start, end, bank):
        """
        :type start: str
        :type end: str
        :type bank: List[str]
        :rtype: int
        """
        def difCount(str1,str2):
            res = 0
            for i in range(len(str1)):
                if str1[i]!=str2[i]:
                    res += 1
                    if res > 1:
                        return False
            return res == 1
        
        stack = []
        done = set()
        done.add(start)
        stack.append([start, 0])
        while stack:
            current, steps = stack.pop(0)
            if current == end:
                return steps
            for vd in bank:
                if difCount(current, vd) and vd not in done:
                    done.add(vd)
                    stack.append([vd,steps+1])
            
        return -1
```
