# 414. Third Maximum Number

Given a **non-empty** array of integers, return the **third** maximum number in this array. If it does not exist, return the maximum number. The time complexity must be in O(n).

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [3, 2, 1]

Output: 1

Explanation: The third maximum is 1.
```



**Example 2:**

```
Input: [1, 2]

Output: 2

Explanation: The third maximum does not exist, so the maximum (2) is returned instead.
```



**Example 3:**

```
Input: [2, 2, 3, 1]

Output: 1

Explanation: Note that the third maximum here means the third maximum distinct number.
Both numbers with value 2 are both considered as second maximum.
```



## Code

```python
class Solution(object):
    def thirdMax(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        res = [float('-inf'),float('-inf'),float('-inf')]
        for num in nums:
            if num not in res:
                if num > res[0]:
                    res = [num,res[0],res[1]]
                elif num > res[1]:
                    res = [res[0],num,res[1]]
                elif num > res[2]:
                    res = [res[0],res[1],num]
        return res[2] if res[2]!=float('-inf') else res[0]
```
