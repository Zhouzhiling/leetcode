# 438. Find All Anagrams in a String

Given a string **s** and a **non-empty** string **p**, find all the start indices of **p**'s anagrams in **s**.

Strings consists of lowercase English letters only and the length of both strings **s** and **p** will not be larger than 20,100.

The order of output does not matter.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
s: "cbaebabacd" p: "abc"

Output:
[0, 6]

Explanation:
The substring with start index = 0 is "cba", which is an anagram of "abc".
The substring with start index = 6 is "bac", which is an anagram of "abc".
```



**Example 2:**

```
Input:
s: "abab" p: "ab"

Output:
[0, 1, 2]

Explanation:
The substring with start index = 0 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".
The substring with start index = 1 is "ba", which is an anagram of "ab".
The substring with start index = 2 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".
```



## Code

```python
class Solution(object):
    def findAnagrams(self, s, p):
        """
        :type s: str
        :type p: str
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        res = []
        length = len(s)
        if length < len(p):
            return res
        table = [0 for _ in range(26)]
        for ch in p:
            table[ord(ch)-ord('a')] += 1
            
        st = 0
        ed = 0
        while ed < len(p):
            table[ord(s[ed])-ord('a')] -= 1
            ed += 1
        if all(num == 0 for num in table):
                res.append(st)
            
        while ed < length:
            table[ord(s[st])-ord('a')] += 1
            table[ord(s[ed])-ord('a')] -= 1
            st += 1
            ed += 1
            
            if all(num == 0 for num in table):
                res.append(st)
            
        return res
```
